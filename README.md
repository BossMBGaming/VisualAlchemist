## Demo<a name="demo"></a>

Visit [http://visualalchemist.prahladyeri.com](http://visualalchemist.prahladyeri.com) to see a live demo of how this app works.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Visual Alchemist is a pure html app, so you can simply download the [source](https://github.com/prahladyeri/VisualAlchemist/archive/master.zip) and host it (with `index.html` as default).

## Documentation<a name="docs"></a>

Visual Alchemist is under active development, so there is no extensive documentation. However, a brief guide accompanies the app which should help most power users. If you don't understand anything, the best places to visit are the [issue tracker](https://github.com/prahladyeri/VisualAlchemist/issues) and the [VA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisualAlchemist).

## Contribution<a name="contribute"></a>

I'm presently looking for people who can contribute to Visual Alchemist. Mainly in the areas of:

1. Testing: Extensive alpha/beta testing, so our `v1.1` can be a big hit!
2. Code review: There is no such thing as bug-free code and more the number of eyeballs, the better it is.
3. Logo Design: Though a new logo is not immediately necessary, it is still a nice to have, though.
4. Documentation: Docs are very critical at this early of the project, and we don't have any apart from the basic guide accompnied by the app itself.

To support the project by providing financial support, you can send me bitcoins at my wallet no. `1Av4rPGBz5rJVPwewSTDCpYac1rjvkaSzT`. You can also send me donation by paypal at `prahladyeri@yahoo.com`.
